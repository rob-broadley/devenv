# Development Environment
A set up for a development environment centred on tmux (terminal multiplexer), zsh (shell), neovim (text editor), ranger (file manager).
Other handy utilities are also included, see requirements.txt for the packages added to a Fedora base.

## As a Container
The development environment can be run as a container.
The tested approach is to use docker-compose.
To build the container image run: `make image`.
To start a container from the created image run `make container`.


For easy starting from any directory run `make bin` to put `devenv` in `~/.local/bin`.
A container can then be started by calling `devenv`.
`devenv` is a soft link to the script called by `make container`.


If running as above (without any modifications to the docker compose file), then only two locations will be persistent (attached volumes) /home/developer/projects (for your work) and /home/developer/.local/share (for application data).
The host users home directory will also be accessible if needed, it will be mounted in the same location as on the host machine.



### Troubleshooting

#### SSH
If the host is Mac OS you may need to add `IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain` to `~/.ssh/config` for SSH to work.



## WSL Install
To build the image (devenv.tar) run `make image` followed by `make wsl`.
The image can be imported into WSL using `wsl --import devenv (install location) (path to devenv.tar)`.

The default WSL distribution can be set to devenv using `wsl --setdefault devenv`.

If using Windows Terminal set the `command line` option in settings to `wsl --distribution devenv zsh --login` for zsh on start up,
or `wsl --distribution devenv tmux new-session -A -s dev` for tmux on start up.



## Local Install (Unmaintained)
A script to set up the environment for the local user can be produced from the container definition file (Containerfile) by running `make install.sh`.
The produced `install.sh` script should work for recent versions of Fedora, but may need modifying for other distributions / operating systems.



## Miscellaneous

### Fonts
Nerd fonts are recommended to get the most from zsh theme, see [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
